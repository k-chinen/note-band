note-band --- note collection tool instead of rubber band

This packages consists of perl scripts.
They requires DBM::Deep, Tk and Image::Magick .
Use 'cpan' to install them.

I tested these program on CentOS 6.4 and MacOS 10.8 .
Tyical running steps are following:

% ./sweepkeys.pl  ~/Dropbox/SHOT\ NOTE/
% ./sweepvals.pl | tee vals.log
% ./u1.pl

To remove .db files makes cleaning of data-base for this program.
Currently 7 files (pfs.db, dfs.db, dfn.db, doc.db, noc.db, grp.db and ar.db)
are exist.
